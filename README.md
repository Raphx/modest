# Modest

Code with modesty.

No distraction, no addiction, one step closer to nirvana.

Inspired by [nofrils](https://github.com/robertmeta/nofrils).

## Usage

Modest supports uses only 16-color mode. It is built only to be used on terminal vim.

Two color schemes are available, `modest-light` and `modest-dark`.
